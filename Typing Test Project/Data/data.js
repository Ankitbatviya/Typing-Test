    { "id": 11, "text": "Modern tools amplify both skill and incompetence, making weak foundations more visible while rewarding those with disciplined fundamentals." },
    { "id": 12, "text": "Progress measured narrowly can encourage harmful behavior by rewarding surface level improvement while ignoring deeper systemic damage." },
    { "id": 13, "text": "Emotional responses frequently override rational analysis, especially when decisions involve identity, status, or perceived threats." },
